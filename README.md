# Emoji Downloader

An example of using Octokit and Octokit.Reactive to download all of the emoji.

For more details, check out [this blog post](http://haacked.com/archive/2014/06/16/emoji-downloader/).

## Usage

I have examples for both Octokit and Octokit.Reactive. The reactive one downloads 4 images at a time in parallel, so use that. Both are present for educational purposes.

```bash
ReactiveEmojiDownloader.exe c:\path\to\output\emoji
```
